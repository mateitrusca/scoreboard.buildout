The value above (and this file) is created and used by the zc.async
package. It is intended to uniquely identify this software instance when
it is used to start a zc.async dispatcher.  This allows multiple
dispatchers, each in its own software instance, to connect to a single
database to do work.

In order to decide where to look for this file (or to create it, if
necessary), the module looks in ``os.environ['ZC_ASYNC_UUID']`` for a
file name.

If you are using zdaemon (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zdaemon) to
daemonize your process, you can set this in a zdaemon environment section
of your zdaemon.conf. Supervisor (http://supervisord.org/) also provides
this functionality. Other similar tools probably do as well.

If the ``ZC_ASYNC_UUID`` is not found in the environment, it will use
``os.path.join(os.getgwd(), 'uuid.txt')`` as the file name.

To get a new identifier for this software instance, delete this file,
restart Python, and import zc.async.instanceuuid.  This file will be
recreated with a new value.
